# Direct-methods-for-sparse-matrices
The aim of this project is to study the open source implementation of direct solving algorithms of linear systems for sparse arrays, and to compare them with the MATLAB implementation. 

This project is the implementation of the following assigment. [Click here](https://github.com/davidepietrasanta/Direct-methods-for-sparse-matrices-/blob/main/MCS-progetto-1.pdf)

We want to compare MATLAB with three other programming languages: 

## Python 
For Python we have decided to use the `SciPy` library.

## C++
`Unknown library`

## R
For R we have decided to use the `SparseM` library.
