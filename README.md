# Direct-methods-for-sparse-matrices
The aim of this project is to study the open source implementation of direct solving algorithms of linear systems for sparse arrays, and to compare them with the MATLAB implementation. 

This project is the implementation of the following assigment. [Click here](https://github.com/davidepietrasanta/Direct-methods-for-sparse-matrices-/blob/main/MCS-progetto-1.pdf)

We want to compare MATLAB with three other programming languages: 

## Python
`Unknown library`

## C++
`Unknown library`

## R
`Unknown library`
